# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
rails_server/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
rails_server/log/*
rails_server/tmp/*
!rails_server/log/.keep
!rails_server/tmp/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development
rails_server/storage/*
!rails_server/storage/.keep

rails_server.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
